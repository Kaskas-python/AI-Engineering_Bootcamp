How do you find a decent-sounding pair of earbuds that will last at least two years? I've bought DOZENS. If they're expensive and sound great, one earbud inevitably fails. Fast. If they're inexpensive, the sound quality is so poor you don't want to use the earbuds. I thought I'd try these out to see if I could replace my expensive bluetooth earbuds whose battery just died. These have such a tinny sounding treble that I can't understand what speakers are saying (movies, music). The bass is decent and the volume gets higher than my bluetooth sets' volumes, but the sound quality is so muddy that I know I'd use these only in emergencies.<br /><br />The sound also doesn't have a natural stage. The left earbud gets far more of the sound. If you increase the volume to hear out of the right earbud, the left earpiece distorts.<br /><br />What a shame. I thought at this price, I'd have a backup pair of earbuds while I research a day-to-day version. But I would rather listen to nothing than struggle through trying to understand what's being said through these. Another knock against these inexpensive buds is poor fit. They keep falling out of my ears. You get only one pair of ear inserts with these, so if they don't fit your ears, you're out of luck. On the bright side, the ear inserts these buds come with pop off easily so you can try putting on other inserts--which is what I did with my now dead BT headset's comfort inserts.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend these earbuds. The most important feature of headphones is sound quality. If the sound is so poor as to make you uncomfortable or make words unintelligible, nothing else matters about the headphones.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping, Recommended, AAA+++ ok\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Waste of money even when I first used them the left ear was very quiet and the right ear worked very well I used them for about an hour to watch a documentary for school.

How do you find a decent-sounding pair of earbuds that will last at least two years? I've bought DOZENS. If they're expensive and sound great, one earbud inevitably fails. Fast. If they're inexpensive, the sound quality is so poor you don't want to use the earbuds. I thought I'd try these out to see if I could replace my expensive bluetooth earbuds whose battery just died. These have such a tinny sounding treble that I can't understand what speakers are saying (movies, music). The bass is decent and the volume gets higher than my bluetooth sets' volumes, but the sound quality is so muddy that I know I'd use these only in emergencies.<br /><br />The sound also doesn't have a natural stage. The left earbud gets far more of the sound. If you increase the volume to hear out of the right earbud, the left earpiece distorts.<br /><br />What a shame. I thought at this price, I'd have a backup pair of earbuds while I research a day-to-day version. But I would rather listen to nothing than struggle through trying to understand what's being said through these. Another knock against these inexpensive buds is poor fit. They keep falling out of my ears. You get only one pair of ear inserts with these, so if they don't fit your ears, you're out of luck. On the bright side, the ear inserts these buds come with pop off easily so you can try putting on other inserts--which is what I did with my now dead BT headset's comfort inserts.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend these earbuds. The most important feature of headphones is sound quality. If the sound is so poor as to make you uncomfortable or make words unintelligible, nothing else matters about the headphones.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping, Recommended, AAA+++ ok\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Waste of money even when I first used them the left ear was very quiet and the right ear worked very well I used them for about an hour to watch a documentary for school.

How do you find a decent-sounding pair of earbuds that will last at least two years? I've bought DOZENS. If they're expensive and sound great, one earbud inevitably fails. Fast. If they're inexpensive, the sound quality is so poor you don't want to use the earbuds. I thought I'd try these out to see if I could replace my expensive bluetooth earbuds whose battery just died. These have such a tinny sounding treble that I can't understand what speakers are saying (movies, music). The bass is decent and the volume gets higher than my bluetooth sets' volumes, but the sound quality is so muddy that I know I'd use these only in emergencies.<br /><br />The sound also doesn't have a natural stage. The left earbud gets far more of the sound. If you increase the volume to hear out of the right earbud, the left earpiece distorts.<br /><br />What a shame. I thought at this price, I'd have a backup pair of earbuds while I research a day-to-day version. But I would rather listen to nothing than struggle through trying to understand what's being said through these. Another knock against these inexpensive buds is poor fit. They keep falling out of my ears. You get only one pair of ear inserts with these, so if they don't fit your ears, you're out of luck. On the bright side, the ear inserts these buds come with pop off easily so you can try putting on other inserts--which is what I did with my now dead BT headset's comfort inserts.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend these earbuds. The most important feature of headphones is sound quality. If the sound is so poor as to make you uncomfortable or make words unintelligible, nothing else matters about the headphones.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping, Recommended, AAA+++ ok\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Waste of money even when I first used them the left ear was very quiet and the right ear worked very well I used them for about an hour to watch a documentary for school.

How do you find a decent-sounding pair of earbuds that will last at least two years? I've bought DOZENS. If they're expensive and sound great, one earbud inevitably fails. Fast. If they're inexpensive, the sound quality is so poor you don't want to use the earbuds. I thought I'd try these out to see if I could replace my expensive bluetooth earbuds whose battery just died. These have such a tinny sounding treble that I can't understand what speakers are saying (movies, music). The bass is decent and the volume gets higher than my bluetooth sets' volumes, but the sound quality is so muddy that I know I'd use these only in emergencies.<br /><br />The sound also doesn't have a natural stage. The left earbud gets far more of the sound. If you increase the volume to hear out of the right earbud, the left earpiece distorts.<br /><br />What a shame. I thought at this price, I'd have a backup pair of earbuds while I research a day-to-day version. But I would rather listen to nothing than struggle through trying to understand what's being said through these. Another knock against these inexpensive buds is poor fit. They keep falling out of my ears. You get only one pair of ear inserts with these, so if they don't fit your ears, you're out of luck. On the bright side, the ear inserts these buds come with pop off easily so you can try putting on other inserts--which is what I did with my now dead BT headset's comfort inserts.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend these earbuds. The most important feature of headphones is sound quality. If the sound is so poor as to make you uncomfortable or make words unintelligible, nothing else matters about the headphones.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping, Recommended, AAA+++ ok\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Waste of money even when I first used them the left ear was very quiet and the right ear worked very well I used them for about an hour to watch a documentary for school.

How do you find a decent-sounding pair of earbuds that will last at least two years? I've bought DOZENS. If they're expensive and sound great, one earbud inevitably fails. Fast. If they're inexpensive, the sound quality is so poor you don't want to use the earbuds. I thought I'd try these out to see if I could replace my expensive bluetooth earbuds whose battery just died. These have such a tinny sounding treble that I can't understand what speakers are saying (movies, music). The bass is decent and the volume gets higher than my bluetooth sets' volumes, but the sound quality is so muddy that I know I'd use these only in emergencies.<br /><br />The sound also doesn't have a natural stage. The left earbud gets far more of the sound. If you increase the volume to hear out of the right earbud, the left earpiece distorts.<br /><br />What a shame. I thought at this price, I'd have a backup pair of earbuds while I research a day-to-day version. But I would rather listen to nothing than struggle through trying to understand what's being said through these. Another knock against these inexpensive buds is poor fit. They keep falling out of my ears. You get only one pair of ear inserts with these, so if they don't fit your ears, you're out of luck. On the bright side, the ear inserts these buds come with pop off easily so you can try putting on other inserts--which is what I did with my now dead BT headset's comfort inserts.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend these earbuds. The most important feature of headphones is sound quality. If the sound is so poor as to make you uncomfortable or make words unintelligible, nothing else matters about the headphones.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping, Recommended, AAA+++ ok\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Waste of money even when I first used them the left ear was very quiet and the right ear worked very well I used them for about an hour to watch a documentary for school.

How do you find a decent-sounding pair of earbuds that will last at least two years? I've bought DOZENS. If they're expensive and sound great, one earbud inevitably fails. Fast. If they're inexpensive, the sound quality is so poor you don't want to use the earbuds. I thought I'd try these out to see if I could replace my expensive bluetooth earbuds whose battery just died. These have such a tinny sounding treble that I can't understand what speakers are saying (movies, music). The bass is decent and the volume gets higher than my bluetooth sets' volumes, but the sound quality is so muddy that I know I'd use these only in emergencies.<br /><br />The sound also doesn't have a natural stage. The left earbud gets far more of the sound. If you increase the volume to hear out of the right earbud, the left earpiece distorts.<br /><br />What a shame. I thought at this price, I'd have a backup pair of earbuds while I research a day-to-day version. But I would rather listen to nothing than struggle through trying to understand what's being said through these. Another knock against these inexpensive buds is poor fit. They keep falling out of my ears. You get only one pair of ear inserts with these, so if they don't fit your ears, you're out of luck. On the bright side, the ear inserts these buds come with pop off easily so you can try putting on other inserts--which is what I did with my now dead BT headset's comfort inserts.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend these earbuds. The most important feature of headphones is sound quality. If the sound is so poor as to make you uncomfortable or make words unintelligible, nothing else matters about the headphones.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping, Recommended, AAA+++ ok\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Waste of money even when I first used them the left ear was very quiet and the right ear worked very well I used them for about an hour to watch a documentary for school.

How do you find a decent-sounding pair of earbuds that will last at least two years? I've bought DOZENS. If they're expensive and sound great, one earbud inevitably fails. Fast. If they're inexpensive, the sound quality is so poor you don't want to use the earbuds. I thought I'd try these out to see if I could replace my expensive bluetooth earbuds whose battery just died. These have such a tinny sounding treble that I can't understand what speakers are saying (movies, music). The bass is decent and the volume gets higher than my bluetooth sets' volumes, but the sound quality is so muddy that I know I'd use these only in emergencies.<br /><br />The sound also doesn't have a natural stage. The left earbud gets far more of the sound. If you increase the volume to hear out of the right earbud, the left earpiece distorts.<br /><br />What a shame. I thought at this price, I'd have a backup pair of earbuds while I research a day-to-day version. But I would rather listen to nothing than struggle through trying to understand what's being said through these. Another knock against these inexpensive buds is poor fit. They keep falling out of my ears. You get only one pair of ear inserts with these, so if they don't fit your ears, you're out of luck. On the bright side, the ear inserts these buds come with pop off easily so you can try putting on other inserts--which is what I did with my now dead BT headset's comfort inserts.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend these earbuds. The most important feature of headphones is sound quality. If the sound is so poor as to make you uncomfortable or make words unintelligible, nothing else matters about the headphones.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping, Recommended, AAA+++ ok\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Waste of money even when I first used them the left ear was very quiet and the right ear worked very well I used them for about an hour to watch a documentary for school.

If they're inexpensive, the sound quality is so poor you don't want to use the earbuds. I thought I'd try these out to see if I could replace my expensive bluetooth earbuds whose battery just died. These have such a tinny sounding treble that I can't understand what speakers are saying (movies, music). The bass is decent and the volume gets higher than my bluetooth sets' volumes, but the sound quality is so muddy that I know I'd use these only in emergencies.<br /><br />The sound also doesn't have a natural stage. The left earbud gets far more of the sound. If you increase the volume to hear out of the right earbud, the left earpiece distorts.<br /><br />What a shame. I thought at this price, I'd have a backup pair of earbuds while I research a day-to-day version. But I would rather listen to nothing than struggle through trying to understand what's being said through these. Another knock against these inexpensive buds is poor fit. They keep falling out of my ears. You get only one pair of ear inserts with these, so if they don't fit your ears, you're out of luck. On the bright side, the ear inserts these buds come with pop off easily so you can try putting on other inserts--which is what I did with my now dead BT headset's comfort inserts.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend these earbuds. The most important feature of headphones is sound quality. If the sound is so poor as to make you uncomfortable or make words unintelligible, nothing else matters about the headphones.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Smooth Transaction, Fast Shipping, Recommended, AAA+++ ok\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Waste of money even when I first used them the left ear was very quiet and the right ear worked very well I used them for about an hour to watch a documentary for school. Then a week later when I go to use them for a second time they do not work. Waste of money.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: A bit harsh... I needed a cheap fast solution, and these did the trick.  However, compared to every other headset I have, these are harsh sounding and if used with any significant volume left my ears ringing.<br /><br />You cannot, however, beat the price when you need a very fast solution to a problem.  They are a good backup when my wireless headset loses its  charge.\\n- ID: B09VB5M3L5, review: Not to bad for cheapos. You definitely get what you pay for and I didn't pay much for these.
